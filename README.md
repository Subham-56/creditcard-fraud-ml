# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using **Logistic Regression**.  
This project is based on the **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset**, where each transaction is labeled as **legit (0)** or **fraud (1)**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, we:
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Visualize class imbalance  
3. Split the data into training and testing sets  
4. Scale numerical features  
5. Train a **Logistic Regression** model  
6. Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
7. Visualize the confusion matrix  

This is a great first ML project if you’ve completed **Andrew Ng’s first Machine Learning course** and want to apply those concepts to a real dataset.
